======================

The MultiSiteSearch component has received little attention lately. It was an attempt to replace the LinkedDataIndexer https://github.com/vivo-project/Linked-Data-Indexer which is the basis for http://beta.vivosearch.org. Unfortunately, the MultiSiteSearch effort reached the end of its funding before reaching operational status.

Other tools have been created to search multiple VIVO sites, but there is still interest in reviving MultiSiteSearch. Perhaps you would like to be part of such an effort?
